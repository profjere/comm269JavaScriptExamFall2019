# Answer the following six questions in a Microsoft Word document.

1)	What is the purpose of JavaScript in web development? [5 points]

2)	Explain how the if/then statement works?  What is its purpose? [10 points]

3)	Explain why a function is necessary if you are collecting data from a form.  (Note: functions have many uses, but this is one that we discussed/used in class.) [10 points]

4)	Given the following two lines of code, what would be printed in the Javascript console? [10 points]
```
var dairy = ['provolone','yogurt','milk','brie'];
console.log(dairy[1]);
```

5)	Given the following two lines of code, what numbers would be printed in the Javascript console? [10 points]
```
For (var i=0; i<100; i=i+15){
console.log(i)}
```
6) Correct the five errors: or to put it another way, there are five changes to make this work.  Your intention is to create a program that prints an asterisk in the Javascript console as many times as dictated by the random number selected in the first line:
```
var x=Math.rug(Math.random()*100);

for var i=0; i>x; x)
  console.log('*');
}
```
