# Answer the following six questions in a Microsoft Word document.

1)	What is the purpose of JavaScript in web development? [5 points]

2)	Explain how the if/then statement works?  What is its purpose? [10 points]

3)	Explain why a function is necessary if you are collecting data from a form.  (Note: functions have many uses, but this is one that we discussed/used in class.) [10 points]

4)	Given the following two lines of code, what would be printed in the Javascript console? [10 points]
```
var dairy = ['provolone','yogurt','milk','brie'];
console.log(dairy[1]);
```

5)	Given the following two lines of code, what numbers would be printed in the Javascript console? [10 points]
```
For (var i=0; i<100; i=i+15){
console.log(i)}
```
6) Correct the five errors: or to put it another way, there are five changes to make this work.  Your intention is to create a program that prints an asterisk in the Javascript console as many times as dictated by the random number selected in the first line. [15 points]
```
var x=Math.rug(Math.random()*100);

for var i=0; i>x; x)
  console.log('*');
}
```

7) Create a Javascript program that creates the following output directly onto an HTML page.
```
-|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
```

You will receive zero points if you only submit an HTML page with the above characters.  If you use Javascript to create the above characters in one string (x= "-|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|"), you will receive seven points.  If you use Javascript to create the above characters with no single string in the code having more than one character, you will receive the full 15 points.  (In other words, only use '' or '-' or '|').  The vertical line is created with the key above the return key (and by pressing shift).
